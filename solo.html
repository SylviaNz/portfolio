                        Solo Bubble is a New Zealand born, quick-service beverage company, started in 2020 by a Taiwanese girl that serves uniquely flavored tea paired with toppings that originated in Taiwan.

            <h2>Problem & Challenge</h2>
            <p>As someone who frequent drinks bubble tea weekly, I am very familiar with the long lines that run out the door, and how long it takes to get a drink. However, I was curious to find out what other customers thought about the wait in bubble tea shops:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> ‚ÄúAfter a 45 minute waiting, I was expecting my mind to be blown.‚Äù</li>
                    <li>‚ÄúYeah I like the design of the shop and it's pretty hip. But I think it's not worth more than 20 mins of wait kind of good.‚Äú</li>
                    <li>
                        ‚ÄúYou would think it would be quick since it's only tea they are serving, but it took at least 30 minutes of a wait.‚Äù</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Solo Bubble has become so popular that customers are frustrated with waiting up to 45 minutes to receive their drinks. We are developing a mobile app for customers to order drinks quickly so that they don‚Äôt have to wait in long lines and staff can feel less pressure and work more efficiently in the same time. Also Solo Bubble benefits from this app because they are able to process more orders and in turn generate more revenue through the app.</p>

            <p>Based on information I gathered my research, I created a persona named Elsie, who represents the key audience of Solo Bubble. She is a heavy social media user and is passionate to try different foods. She likes to share food and beverage experiences on Instagram and also to write reviews on Google map. </p>

                <p>Based on my experience with takeaway app, I made a goal to make the checkout process much more easier and seamless with Solo Bubble. According to the research, I created Solo Bubble user flow to organize the features in different sections of the mobile app, which was also used as the information architecture for the app.

        <h2>Design System</h2>
        <p>I wanted to go with something that would give out clean lab vibes while facing the majority of young customers. I chose two different kind of purple colors as I felt that would be best suited for users between 20-35 who love to try new beverages and their personailty is more funky and street style.<br><br> I also gave two functions for these two colors - Dark purple is for confirming your choice, and vivid purple is for decision has been made and highlight.<br><br> In this case, users can easily know the steps and process they have gone through and also find important information by colors. A clean layout and simple process is always the best choice when designing a mobile app. I also counted users only click 6 times buttons from opening app to finish order to get time notification to pick up. This way is not only save time for users also benefits to Solo Bubble to get more orders.
